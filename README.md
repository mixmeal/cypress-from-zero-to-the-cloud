# TAT-CSC

Sample project to demonstrate my progress in course cypress-from-zero-to-the-cloud [https://www.udemy.com/course/cypress-from-zero-to-the-cloud/].

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have git, Node.js and npm installed to clone and run this project.

> I used versions `2.34.1`, `v18.15.0`, and `9.5.0.` of git, Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later LTS versions.

## Installation

After cloning the repository and accessing it, run npm install cypress@13.1.0 --save-dev (or npm i cypress@13.1.0 -D for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

You can run the tests in headless mode or in interactive mode.

## Interactive mode

Run `npm run cy:open` to open the Cypress App and run the tests in interactive mode in a desktop viewport.
Or run `npm run cy:open:mobile` to open the Cypress App and run the tests in mobile viewport.

## Headless mode

Run `npm test` to run the tests in headless mode in a desktop viewport.
Or run `npm run test:mobile` to run the tests in headless mobile viewport.
